                  and in dense monolayers adsorbed on the (111)
                  surfaces of the Ni-group metals have been
                  investigated within the framework of
                  density-functional theory using generalized response
                  and force-constant techniques. For isolated CH 3 SH
                  good agreement of eigenfrequencies and intensities
                  with the measured infrared spectra is achieved. For
                  the CH 3 S radical, experimental information from
                  laser-induced fluorescence spectroscopy is available
                  only for selected eigenmodes. The theoretical
                  predictions show reasonable agreement for the CH
                  deformation and CS stretching modes, but predict
                  much higher CH stretching frequencies in better
                  agreement with estimates based on the vibrational
                  fine structure of the photoemission spectra. For
                  methane-thiol monolayers on Ni(111) and Pt(111) the
                  calculations predict stronger red-shifts of the SH
                  and CS stretching modes than reported from
                  high-resolution electron energy loss
                  spectroscopy (HREELS) on condensed multilayers which
                  average over the first layer adsorbed on the metal
                  and further physisorbed molecular layers. For
                  methane-thiolate monolayers the calculations predict
                  modest blue-shifts of the CH stretching and rocking
                  modes and for the asymmetric CH deformation
                  modes. Red-shifts are predicted for the symmetric CH
                  deformation and for the CS stretching
                  modes. Reasonable agreement with HREELS is
                  achieved. The increased differences between
                  symmetric and asymmetric CH stretching and
                  deformation modes induced by the adsorption is a
                  consequence of the strongly tilted adsorption
                  geometries.}

                  quantification of the activation energies of such
                  transformations. Our approach is a generalization of
                  a previous method for identifying transition states
                  for chemical reactions, namely the climbing
                  image-nudged elastic band algorithm, where here the
                  global deformation of the crystalline lattice
                  (volume and shape fluctuations) becomes the reaction
                  coordinate instead of atomic motion. We also
                  introduce an analogue to the BornOppenheimer
                  approximation that allows a decoupling of nuclear
                  motion and lattice deformation, where the nuclear
                  positions along the path are determined
                  variationally according to current deformation
                  state. We then apply this technique to characterize
                  the energetics of elemental lithium phase
                  transformations as a function of applied pressure,
                  where we see a validation of the
                  BornOppenheimer-like approximation, small energy
                  barriers (expected for martensitic transformations),
                  and a pronounced pressure dependence of various

  abstract =     {This paper addresses the problem of calculating the
                  vacancy formation energy in simple metals and
                  presents results for aluminium. The calculations are
                  based on the pseudopotential method, the
                  local-density approximation for exchange and
                  correlation, and periodically repeating
                  geometry. The approach used is similar to that
                  proposed by Car and Parrinello, and allows the
                  simultaneous relaxation of the electrons and the
                  ionic positions. Problems peculiar to metals in this
                  approach are discussed and a way of overcoming them
                  is presented. The calculated vacancy energy (0.56
                  eV) in aluminium is in quite good agreement with
                  experiment (0.66 eV). Comparisons with perturbation
                  theory show that the calculated value is subject to
                  a technical error of only approximately 0.03 eV and
                  that corrections due to periodic boundary conditions
                  are also of this order. The contribution to the
                  vacancy energy from non-linear effects is similar to
                  the jellium estimate of Evans and Finnis.}
