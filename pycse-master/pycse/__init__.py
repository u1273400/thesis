# * load some common libraries

# The goal here is to make it easy for beginners to get started with a minimal
# amount of importing libraries. This is not what most expert programmers would
# do, and it is not for them. This tries to mimic the behavior of Matlab where
# every function you want is in the global namespace. This is a transition
# behavior to allow students to focus on problem solving and not on Python
# library imports.
